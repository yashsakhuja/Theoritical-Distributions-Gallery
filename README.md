# Theoritical-Distributions-Gallery

Here's the link to the Streamlit deployed webapp: https://yashsakhuja-theoritical-distributi-distributions-gallery-mhgbxa.streamlit.app/

In an attempt to dive deep into the StreamLit library I tried to to create an Interactive Gallery for all theroititcal distributions in statistics. It covers some frequently used continuous and discrete distributions.

Some common distributions included here are:
> Normal Distribution
> Poisson Distribution
> Exponential Distribution
> Uniform Distribution (Continuous)
> Gamma Distribution
> Erlang Distribution
> LogNormal Distribution
> Uniform Distribution (Discrete)
> Binomial Distribution 

I'd love to constantly extend to this gallery in the future!
